; Exercise 2.1:
; Define a better version of make-rat that handles both positive and negative
; arguments. Make-rat should normalize the sign so that if the rational number
; is positive, both the numerator and denominator are positive, and if the
; rational number is negative, only the numerator is negative.

; It already does that. Example:
(print-rat (make-rat 4 -5))
; returns -4/5

; Exercise 2.2:
; Consider the problem of representing line segments in a plane. Each segment
; is represented as a pair of points: a starting point and an ending point.
; Define a constructor make-segment and selectors start-segment and end-segment
; that define the representation of segments in terms of points. Furthermore, a
; point can be represented as a pair of numbers: the x coordinate and the y
; coordinate. Accordingly, specify a constructor make-point and selectors
; x-point and y-point that define this representation. Finally, using your
; selectors and constructors, define a procedure midpoint-segment that takes a
; line segment as argument and returns its midpoint (the point whose
; coordinates are the average of the coordinates of the endpoints). To try your
; procedures, youâ€™ll need a way to print points:
