; Quoting book:
; Newtonâ€™s method for cube roots is based on the fact that if y is an
; approximation to the cube root of x, then a better approximation is given by
; the value:
;
; x/y2+2y
; -------
;   3
;
; Use this formula to implement a cube-root procedure analogous to the
; square-root procedure.
